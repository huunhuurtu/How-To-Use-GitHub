There are two main parts concerning what GitHub brings for research:
-	Citable code for academic software
Creation of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) used to uniquely identify objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization for repositories on GitHub.
Avoid plagiarism and gives credit to the original researcher, who gain citation through posting codes on GitHub.
-	Academic accounts on GitHub
More freedom and possibilities, having private repositories, group repositories.
So interesting for research groups and also keep research private until publication to avoid someone to steal content.
Keeping the advantages of GitHub and being adapted to research.
Check list:
-	Put references for packages, functions, publications
-	Respect common manners of coding like putting useful comment or respecting indentation
-	Put our name and institution to personal code since we can be citated.
-	Share our data if possible for replication purposes
-	A README file for further explanation, context, abstract etcâ€¦
-	Put a way to contact us and all contributors
-	Give credit to contributors for the parts they contributed to
